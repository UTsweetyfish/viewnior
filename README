This is Viewnior, an image viewer program. Created to be simple, fast
and elegant. It's minimalistic interface provides more screenspace for
your images. Among its features are:

  * Fullscreen & Slideshow
  * Rotate, flip, crop, save, delete images

Most of the Viewnior's sources handling image viewing are adopted from
the GtkImageView library by Bj√∂rn Lindqvist. The files were cleaned up
and modified, so that unused functionalities were removed
(GtkImageToolSelector, GtkImageToolPainter, GtkZooms).Prefixes
were changed from gtk_ to uni_ for clarity.

You can get these packages from your favourite GNOME FTP mirror or at
